          You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a
          creature you can see within range. If the target can hear you (though
          it need not understand you), it must succeed on a wisdom saving throw
          or take 1d4 psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack
          roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

          This spell's damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4),
          11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).

          The next time you hit with a melee weapon attack during this spell’s
          duration, your attack deals an extra 1d6 psychic damage. Additionally,
          if the target is a creature, it must make a Wisdom saving throw or be
          frightened of you until the spell ends. As an action, the creature can
          make a Wisdom check against your spell save DC to end this spell.

          The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during the
          spell’s duration, your weapon flares with white-hot intensity, and the
          attack deals an extra 1d6 fire damage to the target and causes the
          target to ignite in flames. At the start of each of its turns until
          the spell ends, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a
          failed save, it takes 1d6 fire damage. On a successful save, the spell
          ends. If the target or a creature within 5 feet of it uses an action
          to put out the flames, or if some other effect douses the flames (such
          as the target being submerged in water), the spell ends.
